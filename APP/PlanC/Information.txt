SenderCode is the Arduino Code fro the device connected with the heart monitor(s).
It takes the values and sends them via bluetooth to the ReceiverArduino that uses ReceiverCode
to read the data, plot it in the serial monitor.

At the same the python code PlotLiveData.py will read the data from the serial monitor, and use
it to plot the two different ECG voltages as a function of the timestamp that the ReceiverCode will
keep inventory of. The used PlotLiveData.py code uses the serial (cmd: pip install pyserial) package
that makes it possible to plot the data live and thus show us real life readings.

SaveDataIntoCSVandPlotPastData is a folder that have an old ReceiverCode that only saved the data into
a csv file (using PuTTY software) so that OldPlotCode.py plotted the lead1 vs lead2 as a function of
the timestamp kept as inventory.

Logging.csv is a .csv file that will have the lead1 vs lead2 data as a function of time.
We used PuTTY to save the plot values in the .csv file.
ExtraLogging.txt is a simple .txt file that we used to store interesting data.
